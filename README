webgpu-native windowing in a single-header library
 - very much work in progress
 - assumes wgpu-native (https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-native); Dawn is not
   currently considered because Google haven't released any binaries (HINT:
   they never did for ANGLE), and their custom python2 build tools... the
   horror... the horror...
 - only X11/Linux currently

see demo/
